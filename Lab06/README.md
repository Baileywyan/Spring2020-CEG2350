# Lab 06 - NOT FINALIZED

## Lab Procedure
Document your progress in a plain text file named `Lab06-LastName.txt`  
where LastName is your last name

At the top of the file please enter your personal details as follows:
```
Name: Your name
Email: Your email

```

Where questions are presented, answer them in your lab notes.  For each step, include the command you  
used to perform the direction or answer the question posed.  If you did something "wrong" make a note  
of it in your lab.  These are learning experiences.

Unless explicity stated, assume you should perform the lab assignment in your AWS Educate environment.  
`ssh -i /path/to/private/key ubuntu@ElasticIP`  OR `aws-ssh` assuming sucessful completion of Lab 04

If you've lost or forgotten your key, you'll need to provision a new stack in AWS Educate and create a new key.  
See [Remaking your AWS Educate environment](../../..) for instructions.

## Part 1 - More Git Practice
1. Go to your AWS Educate environment.
2. In your CEG2350 git repository, create a new folder called `Lab06`.
3. Add the folder for tracking, and commit and push the folder to your GitHub repository.

## Part 2 - Regular Expression Challenge
1. Create a file in `Lab06` called `regex-demo.md`.  What does the .md extension mean for a git repository?
2. Craft a regular expression that meets the following criteria.
* 
3. Write two examples the regular expression works with and one example that will not work.
4. Commit and push your `regex-demo.md` into your git repo.  Write the command you used.
