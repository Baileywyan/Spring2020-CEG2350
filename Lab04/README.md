# Lab 4 - NOT FINALIZED

## Lab Procedure
Document your progress in a plain text file named `Lab04-LastName.txt`  
where LastName is your last name

At the top of the file please enter your personal details as follows:
```
Name: Your name
Email: Your email

```

Where questions are presented, answer them in your lab notes.  For each step, include the command you  
used to perform the direction or answer the question posed.  If you did something "wrong" make a note  
of it in your lab.  These are learning experiences.

Unless explicity stated, assume you should perform the lab assignment in your AWS Educate environment.  
`ssh -i /path/to/private/key ubuntu@ElasticIP`  

If you've lost or forgotten your key, you'll need to provision a new stack in AWS Educate and create a new key.  
See [Remaking your AWS Educate environment](../../..) for instructions.
